The goal of project is to provide R functions and example datasets to help process, review, validate, and analyze Cost and Software Data Reporting (CSDR) data.  

This project is very early in its life cycle, breaking changes and format revisions should be expected. Interested contributors should see the [issues log](https://github.com/daniel-r-germony/dstCSDR/issues) which are loosely grouped by  [project](https://github.com/daniel-r-germony/dstCSDR/projects?query=is%3Aopen).  

More info on CSDR data can be found at the following websites:
