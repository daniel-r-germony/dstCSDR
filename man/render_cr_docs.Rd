\usage{
render_cr_docs(params_path = file.choose(), output_dir = choose.dir(),
  files_to_render = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{params_path}{Required. A full path to a filled-in
"cost_reporting_params.xlsx" file. If a path is not provided to the
function call, a file selection box will be opened.}

\item{output_dir}{Required. A directory path to where the user wants the
generated files to be placed. If a path is not passed by Windows users, a
pop-up box will appear. Non-Windows users must pass a directory path.}

\item{files_to_render}{Optional. Specify which files are rendered and how
they are returned. Options:
\describe{
\item{\code{"default"}}{The default value and will render and return the
following:
\enumerate{
\item SOW: All SOW language in one ".docx" file.
\item CDRLs: All cost reporting CDRLs in one ".docx" file.
}}
\item{\code{"PPM_ready"}}{Returns the same files as \code{"default"}
but splits the CDRL document into multiple files (each CSDR CDRL gets
its own file and each non-CSDR CDRL gets lumped into one file) for
easier uploading into the CADE PPM.
}}}
}
